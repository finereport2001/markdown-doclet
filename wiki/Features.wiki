#summary Basic details features

= Features =

* Include Markdown (and HTML) in Javadoc comments and see formatted HTML in your Javadoc html
* Some tweaks to the default CSS styles to make Javadocs easier to read

= Credit =

I can't claim much credit for this project - it's pretty much a big mash up of the following projects -

* Sun Standard Java Doclet
* MarkdownJ
* UMLGraph

It was necessary to drop in the UMLGraph source due to the inability to easily configure another doclet to drop in as a replacement.

On the upside, the markdown doclet is a drop-in one-stop-shop replacement for nice looking, UML including Javadocs.
